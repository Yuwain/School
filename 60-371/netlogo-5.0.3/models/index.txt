For instance, a tree can be thought of as a fractal since if you look at the tree as a whole, you see a stick, that is to say the trunk, with branches coming out of it.  Then if you look at a smaller portion of it, say a branch, you see a similar thing, namely, a stick with branches coming out of it.

In this model you can orchestrate the DNA replication fork process that occurs in the cells of all living creatures before cells divide.  Both mitosis and meiosis rely on this process to make copies of existing DNA before making new cells.
models/Curricular Models/BEAGLE Evolution/Fish Tank Genetic Drift.nlogo
This is a genetic drift model that shows how gene frequencies change in a population due to purely random events.  The effect of random selection of certain individuals in a population (either through death or through reproduction) and/or the effect of random selection as to which chromosome (from every chromosome pair) end up being sorted into each gamete (sex cells), results in the loss or gains of alleles in the population.
models/Curricular Models/BEAGLE Evolution/GenDrift T interact.nlogo
This model is an example of random selection. It shows that turtles that randomly exchange colors converge on a single color.  The idea, explained in more detail in Dennett's "Darwin's Dangerous Idea", is that trait drifts can occur without any particular purpose or "selective pressure".

This is a model of a selective breeding program of birds.  In the scenario presented in the model the user assumes the role of a bird breeder, whose goal is to breed a line of  "fancy" looking birds through managing a selective breeding program with other breeders (players).
models/Curricular Models/BEAGLE Evolution/HubNet Activities/Bug Hunters Competition.nlogo
This model shows how competition emerges between individuals in the same population.  In a consumer / producer ecosystem, competition for shared resources emerges whenever there is a limited sappy of those resources.  Such competition may be intentional or unintentional, but similar outcomes result in either case - some individuals outcompete others for those shared resources.
models/Curricular Models/BEAGLE Evolution/HubNet Activities/Critter Designers.nlogo
This model simulates competition between many different species in a complex ecosystem. The outcome of the competition shows that when all individuals in a population are identical to each other, the competitive advantage of a species will continue to change compared to other species when the environmental conditions keep changing.
models/Curricular Models/BEAGLE Evolution/HubNet Activities/Fish Spotters.nlogo
This is a HubNet activity of natural selection.  This selection model shows how the interaction of mates and predators on a population can generate two opposing pressures from natural selection. One of these pressures is from sexual selection and the other is from predation.
models/Curricular Models/BEAGLE Evolution/Mimicry.nlogo
Batesian mimicry is an evolutionary relationship in which a harmless species (the mimic) has evolved so that it looks very similar to a completely different species that isn't harmless (the model).  A classic example of Batesian mimicry is the similar appearance of monarch butterflies and viceroy moths. Monarchs and viceroys are unrelated species that are both colored similarly --- bright orange with black patterns. Their colorations are so similar, in fact, that the two species are virtually indistinguishable from one another.

This model lets you conduct experiments in Mendelian genetics with cross fertilization in a population of flowering plants.
models/Curricular Models/BEAGLE Evolution/Plant Speciation.nlogo
This is a model of parapatric speciation, where two subpopulations of a species split into two non-interbreeding species while still remaining in contact with each other. This is in contrast to allopatric speciation, where two geographically separated subpopulations of a species diverge into two separate species. The specific situation modeled is that of the speciation of a metal-tolerant variety of plant on the boundary between clean and contaminated ground.
models/Curricular Models/BEAGLE Evolution/Red Queen.nlogo
This model demonstrates the ideas of competitive co-evolution. In the model there are two species:  frogs and snakes. The snakes are the only predators of the frogs, but the frogs produce a fast acting poison that kills the snakes before they can be eaten. However, the snakes have developed an anti-venom to counter the frog's poison. In this model, we assume that there are no other predators of the frogs, or prey that are consumed by the snakes.  As such the two species enter a biological arms race in order to keep up with each other.
models/Curricular Models/BEAGLE Evolution/Wolf Sheep Predation.nlogo
This model explores the stability of predator-prey ecosystems. Such a system is called unstable if it tends to result in extinction for one or more species involved.  In contrast, a system is stable if it tends to maintain itself over time, despite fluctuations in population sizes.

This model simulates the spread of an infectious disease in a closed population. It is an introductory model in the curricular unit called epiDEM (Epidemiology: Understanding Disease Dynamics and Emergence through Modeling). This particular model is formulated based on a mathematical model that describes the systemic dynamics of a phenomenon that emerges when one infected person is introduced in a wholly susceptible population. This basic model, in mathematical epidemiology, is known as the Kermack-McKendrick model.

This model simulates the behavior of gas particles as the volume changes. In this model, the volume is slowly changing over time by a piston that is rising and falling.  As the piston lowers, the volume of the box decreases and as the piston rises, the volume of the box increases.  This systematic motion of the piston does no work on the particles inside the box.  The piston only serves a mechanism to change the volume of the box.

This model shows how the configuration and sizes of these grains change over time.  Grain size is a very important characteristic for evaluating the mechanical properties of materials; it is exhaustively studied in metallurgy and materials science.
models/Curricular Models/NIELS/Current in a Wire.nlogo
This model shows a simplified microscopic picture of electrical conduction inside a wire connected across two battery terminals. It is based on Drude's free electron theory, and shows how electric current emerges from the collective movement of many electrons inside a wire.
models/Curricular Models/NIELS/Electron Sink.nlogo
This is a simplified model of electrical conduction based on Drude's free electron theory. It shows how electric current in a circuit consisting of a resistive wire connected across two terminals of a battery can be represented as a process of accumulation of free-electrons inside the battery-positive.

models/Curricular Models/NIELS/Parallel Circuit.nlogo
This model offers a microscopic view of electrical conduction in two wires that are connected in parallel to each other across two terminals of a battery. It shows that current in each wire is not always equal to current in the other wire, unlike in a series circuit (see Series Circuit model). However, since each of the wires is connected across the same battery terminals, voltage is the same in each wire.
models/Curricular Models/NIELS/Series Circuit.nlogo
This is a simplified, microscopic model of electrical conduction in a series circuit with two resistors (wires). It is based on Drude's free electron theory. The primary purpose of the model is to illustrate how electric current in one wire gets to be equal to electric current in the other even when the wires have different resistances: higher number of electrons moving slowly (towards the battery positive) in one wire, and fewer electrons moving faster in the other wire.
models/Curricular Models/ProbLab/4 Block Stalagmites.nlogo
4-Block Stalagmites is part of the ProbLab middle-school curricular material for learning probability. Related materials are a random generator called a "marbles scooper" and a sample space called a "combinations tower". In classroom activities, students working with 4-Block Stalagmites will have interacted with the marbles box and built its sample space and thus would have inferred expectations as to outcome distributions in hypothetical experiments with the marbles box.
models/Curricular Models/ProbLab/4 Block Two Stalagmites.nlogo
This model is designed to help students understand the "shape" of the binomial distribution as resulting from how the elemental events are pooled into aggregate events. The model simulates a probability experiment that involves taking samples consisting of four independent binomial events that are each like a coin. Actual experimental outcomes from running this simulation are shown simultaneously in two representations.
models/Curricular Models/ProbLab/4 Blocks.nlogo
4-Blocks simulates an empirical probability experiment in which the randomness generator is a compound of 4 squares that each can independently be either green or blue.  The model helps us conceptualize relations between theoretical and empirical aspects of the binomial function: combinatorial analysis (what we can get) and experimentation (what we actually get).
models/Curricular Models/ProbLab/9-Blocks.nlogo
9-Blocks accompanies classroom work on the Combinations Tower, the giant bell-shaped histogram of all the 512 different green/blue combinations of the 3-by-3 array.  Whereas building the Combinations Tower is a form of theoretical probability --- combinatorial analysis --- the 9-Block model complements with empirical probability of the same 3-by-3 object.  In the plot window, a tall histogram grows that has the same shape as the Combinations Tower.  How can that be?  That is the theme question of this model.
models/Curricular Models/ProbLab/Central Limit Theorem.nlogo
This demonstrates relations between population distributions and their sample mean distributions as well as the affect of sample size on this relation. In this model, a population is distributed by some variable, for instance by their total assets in thousands of dollars. The population is distributed randomly -- not necessarily 'normally' -- but sample means from this population nevertheless accumulate in a distribution that approaches a normal curve. The program allows for repeated sampling of individual specimens in the population.
models/Curricular Models/ProbLab/Dice Stalagmite.nlogo
Dice Stalagmite is a model for thinking about the relations between independent and dependent random events.  Pairs of dice are rolled, then the dice fall into columns in two bar charts.  One of these charts records the dice as two independent outcomes, and the other, as a single compound event (sum) of these two outcomes.  Because the columns grow from the bottom up, we call this a "stalagmite."
models/Curricular Models/ProbLab/Dice.nlogo
"Dice" is a virtual laboratory for learning about probability through conducting and analyzing experiments. You use two dice in the view to perform the experiments. You set up an experiment by choosing a combination consisting of a face for each die, for instance 3 and 4 (we will use this example throughout). Then you "roll" these dice repeatedly and study how often the dice match your chosen combination.
models/Curricular Models/ProbLab/Equidistant Probability.nlogo
Equidistant Probability connects between probability and geometry. You select two or more squares, and the model searches randomly for squares that are equally distant from the squares you selected. To do this random search, creatures pop out of each one of your selected squares and simultaneously step forward one step in some random direction. If they all land in the same square, that's a hit. Can you guess how often this will happen?
models/Curricular Models/ProbLab/Expected Value Advanced.nlogo
Expected Value Advanced illustrates expected-value analysis under the special condition that the sample size varies.  This model extends the ProbLab model Expected Value, where the sample size is fixed.
models/Curricular Models/ProbLab/Expected Value.nlogo
In this model you run experiments that demonstrate the mathematical idea "expected value" (sometimes called "expectation value"). There is a set of different possible outcomes, and each of these outcomes has a different value. The model predicts the expected value based on the probabilities of each of these outcomes. The user can then take samples from the population and compare them to the values predicted by the model.

Partition Permutation Distribution is a model built around the idea of a partition function.

For instance, 4 can be broken up in 5 ways:

Specifically, the model uses combinatorial space, sampling, and distribution in a genotype/phenotype analysis of fish procreation. The model allows you to look "under the hood": you can study a Mendel-type visualization of the combinations of dominant and recessive genes that underlie changes and trends in genetic distribution.
models/Curricular Models/ProbLab/Random Basic Advanced.nlogo
Random Basic Advanced explores the effect of sample size on the distribution of sample mean.
models/Curricular Models/ProbLab/Random Basic.nlogo
Random Basic is the simplest of all the ProbLab models. It can either be used first or as a detour from a more complex model to explain randomness.  This model introduces the user to the random generator in NetLogo. Randomness means that in the short term you cannot guess a value but in the long term all possible values will have occurred more or less equally often.
models/Curricular Models/ProbLab/Random Combinations and Permutations.nlogo
"Random Combinations and Permutations" is a virtual laboratory for learning about probability, and specifically about combinations and permutations, sample space, samples, favored events, and outcome distributions. The model invites you to pick a secret combination and then see how long it takes the computer to find it. The computer discovers your secret combination by just guessing blindly until it happens to guess correctly.
models/Curricular Models/ProbLab/Sample Stalagmite.nlogo
9-Block Stalagmite draws on and connects several central ideas in the study of probability, both theoretical and empirical: combinatorics, sample space, binomial distributions, and frequency distribution function.  In the related curricular material, students use crayons and paper to build the Combinations Tower.  The Combinations Tower is a giant bell-shaped histogram of all the 512 different combinations of a 3-by-3 array of squares that can each be either green or blue.
models/Curricular Models/ProbLab/Sampler Solo.nlogo
SAMPLER Solo is part of the ProbLab curricular models, in which students engage in probability-and-statistics activities as individuals and as a classroom.  SAMPLER stands for Statistics as Multi-Participant Learning-Environment Resource.  It is called "multi-participant", because there is a HubNet version of this model, which was created before the solo version was built.
models/Curricular Models/ProbLab/Shuffle Board.nlogo
Shuffle Board investigates distributions of favored events in a series of outcomes.  The basic analogy is that there are a lot of candy boxes, but only some have prizes in them. You are buying one candy box after another, waiting for prizes, and keeping track of two things: how many boxes do you need to buy until you get a prize? When you had lucky streaks, how long were they?
models/Curricular Models/ProbLab/Stochastic Patchwork.nlogo
Stochastic Patchwork is a simple model for thinking about a profound idea in the domain of probability: the relation between, on the one hand, the independent chance of  elements to take on the value of a favored event, and on the other hand, the distribution of means of grouped outcomes, that is 'samples.'  Should the distribution of sample means reflect the independent probability?  If so, why?  In this dynamic model, a histogram representing the accumulating distribution of sample means grows before our eyes.

models/Curricular Models/Urban Suite/Urban Suite - Economic Disparity.nlogo
This model explores residential land-usage patterns from an economic perspective, using the socio-economic status of the agents to determine their preferences for choosing a location to live.  It models the growth of two populations, one rich and one poor, who settle based on three properties of the landscape: the perceived quality, the cost of living, and the proximity to services (large red dots). These same properties then change based on where the different populations settle.
models/Curricular Models/Urban Suite/Urban Suite - Path Dependence.nlogo
This model explores the concept of path dependence as explained by W. Brian Arthur in his paper, "Urban Systems and Path Dependence" and several other of his papers.  Essentially firms walk around a landscape looking for a place to settle.  Several mechanisms of how they decide where to locate can be simulated, and the results examined.

This model is an examination of the fragile equilibrium of a predator-prey ecosystem. Populations of (1) people, (2) landscape elements and (3) swarms of airborne pollutant-agents compete for resources within an enclosed environment. Using this model, one can explore the behavior of the populations over time as they dynamically interact: the predators (pollution) and prey (people) can be compared over multiple generations as their populations demonstrate regular or irregular reproductive success.

models/Curricular Models/Urban Suite/Urban Suite - Sprawl Effect.nlogo
This model demonstrates a simplified version of city growth and how it leads to urban sprawl and the problems connected with it (e.g. leapfrogging).  Since the rules by which the environment changes and the agents interact are quite simple, the strength of this model is less in attempting to realistically model urban development in detail, and more in demonstrating that certain patterns of behavior and land usage can emerge without requiring overly-complex rules.

This is an adaptation of a popular game created at MIT in the early 1960s that shows how small delays in a distribution system can create big problems.  The participants take on one of four roles in a distribution network for root beer -- the factory, the distributor, the wholesaler, or the retailer.  Each participant places and ships orders while trying to keep their costs to minimum. Costs include the holding inventory as well as missing out on sales because you produced too little root beer.

Students control traffic lights in a real-time traffic simulation.  The teacher controls overall variables, such as the speed limit and the number of cars.  This allows students to explore traffic dynamics, which can lead into many areas of study, from calculus to social studies.
models/HubNet Activities/Unverified/Guppy Spots.nlogo
This selection model shows how sexual attraction and predation change the coloration and patterns in guppy's population.
models/HubNet Activities/Unverified/Investments.nlogo
This model is a simple activity designed to teach compound interest.  Students have a choice between investing their money with a teacher-controlled interest rate or using their money to purchase a car at a teacher defined price.
models/HubNet Activities/Unverified/Minority Game HubNet.nlogo
Minority Game is a simplified model of an economic market.  In each round agents choose to join one of two sides, 0 or 1. Those on the minority side at the end of a round earn a point.  This game is inspired by the "El Farol" bar problem.
models/HubNet Activities/Unverified/Oil Cartel Alternate.nlogo
This activity explores the economics of a market with imperfect competition. As members of a cartel, participants experience how jointly determined price and quantity decisions can be advantageous to suppliers and harmful to consumers, but also why a cartel is so difficult to sustain. In this alternate version of Oil Cartel, members can also explicitly make investments to detect and penalize other members who "cheat" on their agreement, in order to explore the role of accurate information in maintaining a cartel.
models/HubNet Activities/Unverified/Oil Cartel.nlogo
This is a collaborative exploration of the economics of a market with imperfect competition. As members of a cartel, participants experience how jointly determined price and quantity decisions can be advantageous to suppliers, harmful to consumers, but also why a cartel is so difficult to sustain. In this version of Oil Cartel, cartel members face differing profit expectations, and set production and pricing strategies in an attempt to meet those expectations.  They respond to each other's behavior by altering their strategies.
models/HubNet Activities/Unverified/PANDA BEAR.nlogo
Perimeters and Areas by Embodied Agent Reasoning, or PANDA BEAR, is a microworld for mathematics learning that lies at the intersection of dynamic geometry environments and participatory simulation activities. In PANDA BEAR, individual students identify with and control a single vertex of a shared, group-polygon.
models/HubNet Activities/Unverified/Polling Advanced.nlogo
This model can be used to poll data from a set of students using HubNet Clients.  The teacher can input questions to ask and then the students can input their numerical choice (from 0 to 50) in response to the question.  The collective data can then be plotted.
models/HubNet Activities/Unverified/Predator Prey Game.nlogo
This model simulates a predator-prey relationship.  The population consists of wolf packs (predators) and sheep herds (prey), some controlled by students via HubNet clients and some androids controlled by the computer.  The wolves gain energy from consuming sheep, and the sheep gain energy from consuming grass (a primary producer).  The model allows students to examine simple population dynamics like those modeled through the Lotka-Volterra equations in a participatory way.
models/HubNet Activities/Unverified/Prisoners Dilemma HubNet.nlogo
This model is a HubNet version of the Prisoner's Dilemma.  The Prisoner's Dilemma is a famous game-theory situation that models the costs and benefits of collaboration or treason between free agents where there is a struggle over some capital.
models/HubNet Activities/Unverified/Public Good.nlogo
Public Good is a game that asks each of the players to contribute to a common pool that will then be multiplied by the game leader and redistributed to all players.
models/HubNet Activities/Unverified/Restaurants.nlogo
This simulates the competition in a a single industry, in this case the restaurant industry. Each restaurant is controlled by an owner trying to maximize profit. Depending on the owners' decisions, the outcome may demonstrate the Efficient Market Theorem ("Pareto efficiency"): if all the agents within a market look out for their own best interest, it will lead to the most efficient outcome. In this case it means that if the restaurant owners try to maximize their own wealth it will also maximize the customer satisfaction.
models/HubNet Activities/Unverified/Walking.nlogo
Each student defines the motion of a walking character by setting its velocity on their client over time intervals.  The students have 9 different intervals for which they can set the velocity.  They can then send these velocities to their characters, where they see the character walking its route over the 9 intervals.  This is designed to help students understand the accumulation of distance as a function of time. This can serve as a jumping off point for advanced concepts ranging from derivatives and integrals to wave mechanics.
models/Sample Models/Art/Diffusion Graphics.nlogo
Diffusion Graphics is unlike most other NetLogo models, in that it really doesn't 'model' anything. It simply explores the power behind an interesting patch primitive: 'diffuse'.
models/Sample Models/Art/Fireworks.nlogo
This program models the action of fireworks.  Rockets begin at the bottom of the view, shoot upwards into the sky and then explode, emitting showers of falling sparks.
models/Sample Models/Art/Follower.nlogo
In Follower, turtles attempt to "connect" with other turtles, forming long chains according to a small set of simple rules.
models/Sample Models/Art/Optical Illusions.nlogo
This model presents six optical illusions.
models/Sample Models/Art/Sound Machines.nlogo
This model shows one way turtles can make interesting and varied sounds, or if you like, music.  It uses some simple physics to make "machines" that twist, spin, turn, twitch, and bounce.  When a part of the machine touches a wall, ceiling, or floor, it makes a sound.  The pitch of the sound depends on the location of the touch.
models/Sample Models/Art/Unverified/Geometron Top-Down.nlogo
This model uses NetLogo turtles to repeatedly draw circles and other geometric shapes, turning periodically so that the display gives the impression of a kaleidoscope or a pinwheel.

models/Sample Models/Biology/AIDS.nlogo
This model simulates the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), via sexual transmission, through a small isolated human population.  It therefore illustrates the effects of certain sexual practices across a population.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Ant Lines.nlogo
This project models the behavior of ants following a leader towards a food source. The leader ant moves towards the food along a random path; after a small delay, the second ant in the line follows the leader by heading directly towards where the leader is located. Each subsequent ant follows the ant ahead of it in the same manner.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Ants.nlogo
In this project, a colony of ants forages for food. Though each ant follows a set of simple rules, the colony as a whole acts in a sophisticated way.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Autumn.nlogo
If you live in a climate that is warm during the summer and cold in the winter, then you are probably familiar with the beautiful autumn phenomenon in which leaves turn color before dying and falling off of the tree.  This model simulates the ways in which leaves change their colors and fall, making it possible to explore and understand this beautiful annual spectacle.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Daisyworld.nlogo
This model explores the "Gaia hypothesis", which considers the Earth as a single, self-regulating system including both living and non-living parts. In particular, this model explores how living organisms both alter and are altered by climate, which is non-living. The example organisms are daisies and the climatic factor considered is temperature.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Disease Solo.nlogo
Disease Solo is a one-player version of the HubNet activity Disease.  It simulates the spread of a disease through a population.  One agent in the population is a person controlled by the user; the others are "androids" controlled by the computer.

models/Sample Models/Biology/Evolution/Bug Hunt Camouflage.nlogo
This is a model of natural/artificial selection that shows how a population hunted by a predator can develop camouflaging.  For example, in a forest with green leaves, green bugs may emerge as the predominant bug color.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Evolution/Bug Hunt Speeds.nlogo
This is a natural/artificial selection model that shows the result of two competing forces on natural selection of the speed of prey.  Which force dominates depends on the behavior of predators.

models/Sample Models/Biology/Evolution/Echo.nlogo
Echo is a model about the evolution of fitness, adapted from John Holland's book _Hidden Order_ (1995).  It can be used to facilitate experiments in a variety of domains where an agent's fitness varies with its context.  This particular adaptation of Echo  has a biological flavor and refers to the agents as "creatures", and groups of agents with identical mating preferences as "species."
models/Sample Models/Biology/Evolution/Genetic Drift/GenDrift P global.nlogo
This model is an example of random selection.  It shows that patches that randomly exchange colors converge on a single color. The idea, explained in more detail in Dennett's "Darwin's Dangerous Idea", is that trait drifts can occur without any particular purpose or 'selecting pressure'.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Evolution/Genetic Drift/GenDrift P local.nlogo

models/Sample Models/Biology/Evolution/Genetic Drift/GenDrift T reproduce.nlogo
This model is an example of genetic drift.  It shows that competing breeds of turtles, each reproducing with equal likelihood on each turn, will ultimately converge on one breed without any selection pressure forcing this convergence.  The idea, explained in more detail in Dennett's "Darwin's Dangerous Idea", is that trait drifts can occur without any particular purpose or 'selecting pressure'.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Evolution/Mimicry.nlogo
Batesian mimicry is an evolutionary relationship in which a harmless species (the mimic) has evolved so that it looks very similar to a completely different species that isn't harmless (the model).  A classic example of Batesian mimicry is the similar appearance of monarch butterflies and viceroy moths. Monarchs and viceroys are unrelated species that are both colored similarly --- bright orange with black patterns. Their colorations are so similar, in fact, that the two species are virtually indistinguishable from one another.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Evolution/Peppered Moths.nlogo
This project models a classic example of natural selection - the peppered moths of Manchester, England. The peppered moths use their coloration as camouflage from the birds that would eat them. (Note that in this model, the birds act invisibly.) Historically, light-colored moths predominated because they blended in well against the white bark of the trees they rested on.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Evolution/Sunflower Biomorphs.nlogo
A model of evolution where the user provides the selective pressure.  The user picks one or two flowers from a grid of randomly generated animated flowers.  The selected flowers become the "parents" of the next generation.  Over time, the user's selections cause the characteristics of the population to change.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Evolution/Unverified/Divide The Cake.nlogo
This model (and Cooperation and Altruism) are part of the EACH curriculum: "Evolution of Altruistic and Cooperative Habits: Learning About Complexity in Evolution".  See http://ccl.northwestern.edu/cm/EACH/ for more information.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Fireflies.nlogo
This model demonstrates a population of fireflies which synchronize their flashing using only the interactions between the individual fireflies. It is a good example of how a distributed system (i.e. a system with many interacting elements, but no 'leader') can coordinate itself without any central coordinator.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Flocking Vee Formations.nlogo
This is an adaptation of the Flocking model to produce V-like formations in artificial flocks.  Not all birds produce V-like formations when they flock, but they are often observed in large birds traveling together distances (e.g. migrating Canada geese).  This model demonstrates simple rules that cause V-formations to occur.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Flocking.nlogo
This model is an attempt to mimic the flocking of birds.  (The resulting motion also resembles schools of fish.)  The flocks that appear in this model are not created or led in any way by special leader birds.  Rather, each bird is following exactly the same set of rules, from which flocks emerge.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Fur.nlogo
Does a single mechanism underlies such diverse patterns such as the stripes on a zebra, the spots on a leopard, and the blobs on a giraffe?  This model is a possible explanation of how the patterns on animals' skin self-organize. It was first proposed by Alan Turing. If the model is right, then even though the animals may appear to have altogether different patterns, the rules underlying the formation of these patterns are the same and only some of the parameters (the numbers that the rules work on) are slightly different.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Heatbugs.nlogo
Heatbugs is an abstract model of the behavior of biologically-inspired agents that attempt to maintain an optimum temperature around themselves.  It demonstrates how simple rules defining the behavior of agents can produce several different kinds of emergent behavior.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Moths.nlogo
This model demonstrates moths flying in circles around a light.  Each moth follows a set of simple rules.  None of the rules specify that the moth should seek and then circle a light.  Rather, the observed pattern arises out of the combination of the moth's random flight and the simple behavioral rules described below.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Muscle Development.nlogo
This is an exercise physiology model.  It is intended to help you understand the factors involved in generating the appropriate hormonal balance to develop muscle from weight lifting.  These factors include:
models/Sample Models/Biology/Rabbits Grass Weeds.nlogo
This project explores a simple ecosystem made up of rabbits, grass, and weeds. The rabbits wander around randomly, and the grass and weeds grow randomly.   When a rabbit bumps into some grass or weeds, it eats the grass and gains energy. If the rabbit gains enough energy, it reproduces. If it doesn't gain enough energy, it dies.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Shepherds.nlogo
This project is inspired by two simpler models: one of termites gathering wood chips into piles and one of moving sheep.  In this project, sheep wander randomly while shepherds circulate trying to herd them.  Whether or not the sheep eventually end up in a single herd depends on the number of shepherds and how fast they move compared to the sheep.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Simple Birth Rates.nlogo
This is a simple model of population genetics.  There are two populations, the REDS and the BLUES. Each has settable birth rates.  The reds and blues move around and reproduce according to their birth rates.  When the carrying capacity of the terrain is exceeded, some agents die (each agent has the same chance of being selected for death) to maintain a relatively constant population.  The model allows you to explore how differential birth rates affect the ratio of reds to blues.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Slime.nlogo
This project is inspired by the aggregation behavior of slime-mold cells. It shows how creatures can aggregate into clusters without the control of a "leader."
models/Sample Models/Biology/Sunflower Emergent.nlogo
This model shows the characteristic double spiral formation we see in many plants.  Most plants have leaves that spiral up the stem, appearing as a double spiral when viewed from above. This same double spiral is also seen in flower heads such as sunflowers and pine cones.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Sunflower.nlogo
The interlocking spirals found in the seeds, petals and even branches of many plants occur naturally through the growth of the flower.  This model attempts to demonstrate the growth of these naturally occurring spirals.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Termites.nlogo
This project is inspired by the behavior of termites gathering wood chips into piles. The termites follow a set of simple rules. Each termite starts wandering randomly. If it bumps into a wood chip, it picks the chip up, and continues to wander randomly. When it bumps into another wood chip, it finds a nearby empty space and puts its wood chip down.  With these simple rules, the wood chips eventually end up in a single pile.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Tumor.nlogo
This model illustrates the growth of a tumor and how it resists chemical treatment.  A tumor consists of two kinds of cells: stem cells (blue turtles) and transitory cells (all other turtles).
models/Sample Models/Biology/Unverified/Algae.nlogo
This is a model of a simplified aquatic ecosystem consisting of a column of water containing algae, light, and nutrients.  There is more light at the top but more food at the bottom, so algae move up and down to balance their needs.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Unverified/Honeycomb.nlogo
How are groups of bees able to build their honeycombs out of perfect hexagons?  This model illustrates one hypothesis for a possible mechanism.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Unverified/Plant Growth.nlogo
Plants have the interesting tendency to "find" resources in their environment. It is not uncommon to see plants whose leaves and stalks have bent over time in the direction of nearby sunlight, or plants that have grown long roots directed to a nearby source of moisture. It almost seems as if these plants are actually scanning the environment around them to find stable sources of nutrients. Since plants do not have eyes, we might ask how they are able to accomplish this.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Unverified/Tabonuco Yagrumo Hybrid.nlogo
This is a model of a simple ecosystem of two species of trees that compete for space in a forest canopy.  Tabonuco Yagrumo Hybrid is different from Tabonuco Yagrumo in that the competition for space is explicitly modeled using turtles and patches, as opposed to being modeled as a relationship between stocks in the System Dynamics Modeler.  It is intended to be a simple example of how the two approaches can be combined into a hybrid model, and its behavior is similar to the non-hybrid version.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Unverified/Tabonuco Yagrumo.nlogo
This is a system dynamics model of a simple ecosystem.  Two species of trees -- tabonuco and yagrumo -- compete for space in a forest canopy.  This model illustrates the role of hurricane destruction in this ecosystem, as well as the resultant nitrogen and carbon produced by the ecosystem.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Unverified/Wolf Sheep Stride Inheritance.nlogo
This model is a variation on the predator-prey ecosystems model wolf-sheep predation.  
models/Sample Models/Biology/Virus.nlogo
This model simulates the transmission and perpetuation of a virus in a human population.
models/Sample Models/Biology/Wolf Sheep Predation.nlogo
This model explores the stability of predator-prey ecosystems. Such a system is called unstable if it tends to result in extinction for one or more species involved.  In contrast, a system is stable if it tends to maintain itself over time, despite fluctuations in population sizes.
models/Sample Models/Chemistry & Physics/Chemical Reactions/Acids and Bases/Buffer.nlogo
This model demonstrates the behavior of a buffered solution.  A buffer is a solution that resists change in pH when either acid or base are added into it, within limits.  It is best viewed as the third model in the ACID-BASE package.
models/Sample Models/Chemistry & Physics/Chemical Reactions/Acids and Bases/Strong Acid.nlogo
This model demonstrates how chemists and biologists measure the pH of a solution. The value of pH, like many other chemical measurements, emerges from the interactions and relative ratios of the composite molecules within a solution.
models/Sample Models/Chemistry & Physics/Chemical Reactions/Acids and Bases/Unverified/Diprotic Acid.nlogo
This is the fourth model of the Acid-Base subsection of the Connected Chemistry models. It is best explored after the Strong Acid, Weak Acid, and Buffer models. In this model, we have yet another variant on determining the pH of a solution.  This model depicts a diprotic acid, or an acid which can donate two atoms of hydrogen to a base.
models/Sample Models/Chemistry & Physics/Chemical Reactions/Acids and Bases/Weak Acid.nlogo
This model demonstrates the differences in the calculation of pH when evaluating a weak acid in solution. It is best viewed as the second model in the ACID-BASE package.
models/Sample Models/Chemistry & Physics/Chemical Reactions/B-Z Reaction.nlogo
The Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction (or B-Z reaction for short) is an unusual chemical reaction.  Instead of steadily moving towards a single equilibrium state, it oscillates back and forth between two such states.  Before this "chemical oscillator" was discovered, it was thought that such a reaction could not exist.
models/Sample Models/Chemistry & Physics/Chemical Reactions/Enzyme Kinetics.nlogo
This model demonstrates the kinetics of single-substrate enzyme-catalysis. The interactions between enzymes and substrates are often difficult to understand and the model allows users to visualize the complex reaction.
models/Sample Models/Chemistry & Physics/Chemical Reactions/Radical Polymerization.nlogo
This model explains kinetics of radical polymerization.  Radical polymerization can be thought of as the process of agglomeration of small molecules (monomers) into chains (polymer chains) initiated by active particles (radicals).
models/Sample Models/Chemistry & Physics/Chemical Reactions/Simple Kinetics 1.nlogo
This model demonstrates the kinetics of a simple reversible reaction. It demonstrates numerically that the application of the Principle of Stationary Concentrations is valid in this case.
models/Sample Models/Chemistry & Physics/Chemical Reactions/Simple Kinetics 2.nlogo
This model demonstrates the properties of LeChatelier's Principle. This chemical principle states that if a system that is at equilibrium is perturbed, the system will readjust to establish a new equilibrium. For example, if you add reactants to a reversible reaction that is at equilibrium, the system will shift to generate more products and establish a new equilibrium. The principle can also be described with chemical equations.
models/Sample Models/Chemistry & Physics/Chemical Reactions/Simple Kinetics 3.nlogo
This model follows on the Simple Kinetics 2 model.  In Simple Kinetics 2, we saw how changes to variables such as temperature, volume, and concentration affected the rate at which a chemical reaction reached an equilibrium state.  Here we model the same phenomenon based upon a physical separation.
models/Sample Models/Chemistry & Physics/Chemical Reactions/Unverified/Chemical Equilibrium.nlogo
This model shows how a simple chemical system comes to different equilibrium states depending on the concentrations of the initial reactants. Equilibrium is the term we use to describe a system in which there are no macroscopic changes.  This means that the system "looks" like nothing is happening.  In fact, in all chemical systems atomic-level processes continue but in a balance that yields no changes at the macroscopic level.
models/Sample Models/Chemistry & Physics/Crystallization/Crystallization Basic.nlogo
This model shows how grains are formed as a metal crystallizes.  
models/Sample Models/Chemistry & Physics/Crystallization/Crystallization Directed.nlogo
Some metal applications require that a metal's grains form specific patterns. To achieve this, the metal is only cooled from certain sides.  This can be done in several ways.  For example, when molds are made of metal, wires are used to heat up the mold where they want the metal to crystallize last.  For molds made of sand, pieces of metal are put where the liquid metal should crystallize first.  The inserted metal (known as a heat sink), works to quickly suck the heat out of the liquid metal.
models/Sample Models/Chemistry & Physics/Crystallization/Crystallization Moving.nlogo
This model simulates the movement of metal atoms as a system crystallizes.  It is very similar to the Crystallization Basic model, except here the atoms are free to move about.  They randomly move in any direction that is not already occupied by something else, such as another atom or a wall.  Therefore, in order to allow movement, there must be empty spaces between atoms.  Initially these empty spaces, or voids, are randomly distributed, as they would be in a liquid metal.
models/Sample Models/Chemistry & Physics/Diffusion Limited Aggregation/DLA Alternate Linear.nlogo
Like the main DLA model, this model demonstrates diffusion-limited aggregation.  In this variant, instead of particles forming a circular aggregate that grows from a central point, particles form vertical aggregates that grow along an edge.
models/Sample Models/Chemistry & Physics/Diffusion Limited Aggregation/DLA Alternate.nlogo
Like the main DLA model, this model demonstrates diffusion-limited aggregation, in which particles moving (diffusing) in random trajectories stick together (aggregate) to form beautiful treelike branching fractal structures.

models/Sample Models/Chemistry & Physics/Gas Chromatography.nlogo
This is a model of gas chromatography.  Much of modern chemistry depends on chromatography for the separation of chemicals.  (Gas chromatography is one form of chromatography, involving gases.)  Chromatography can even be so sensitive as to separate enantiomers (i.e., molecules that differ only by being mirror images of each other!).

models/Sample Models/Chemistry & Physics/GasLab/Unverified/GasLab Moving Piston.nlogo
This model simulates the behavior of gas particles as the volume changes. In this model, the volume is slowly changing over time by a piston that is rising and falling.  As the piston lowers, the volume of the box decreases and as the piston rises, the volume of the box increases.  This systematic motion of the piston does no work on the particles inside the box.  The piston only serves a mechanism to change the volume of the box.

This project depicts a simple cellular automata model that resembles a pot of boiling water. Heat is applied evenly to the entire pot, but when the temperature of a patch reaches the boiling temperature, the bubble pops and that patch's temperature drops to zero.

This is a model of a magnet at the microscopic level.  The magnetic moments (spins) of the atoms in the magnet can either be up or down.  Spins can change as a result of being influenced by neighboring spins and by the ambient temperature.  The overall behavior of the system will vary depending on the temperature.

Most materials are not continuous arrangements of atoms, but rather composed of thousands or millions of microscopic crystals, known as grains.  This model shows how the configuration and sizes of these grains change over time.  Grain size is a very important characteristic for evaluating the mechanical properties of materials; it is exhaustively studied in metallurgy and materials science.

This model demonstrates diffusion of a quantity through a directed network. The quantity moves among nodes in the network only along established, directed links between two nodes.
models/Sample Models/Networks/Giant Component.nlogo
In a network, a "component" is a group of nodes that are all connected to each other, directly or indirectly.  So if a network has a "giant component", that means almost every node is reachable from almost every other.  This model shows how quickly a giant component arises if you grow a random network.
models/Sample Models/Networks/Preferential Attachment.nlogo
In some networks, a few "hubs" have lots of connections, while everybody else only has a few.  This model shows one way such networks can arise.
models/Sample Models/Networks/Small Worlds.nlogo
This model explores the formation of networks that result in the "small world" phenomenon -- the idea that a person is only a couple of connections away any other person in the world.
models/Sample Models/Networks/Team Assembly.nlogo
This model of collaboration networks illustrates how the behavior of individuals in assembling small teams for short-term projects can give rise to a variety of large-scale network structures over time.  It is an adaptation of the team assembly model presented by Guimera, Uzzi, Spiro & Amaral (2005).  The rules of the model draw upon observations of collaboration networks ranging from Broadway productions to scientific publications in psychology and astronomy.
models/Sample Models/Networks/Virus on a Network.nlogo
This model demonstrates the spread of a virus through a network.  Although the model is somewhat abstract, one interpretation is that each node represents a computer, and we are modeling the progress of a computer virus (or worm) through this network.  Each node may be in one of three states:  susceptible, infected, or resistant.  In the academic literature such a model is sometimes referred to as an SIR model for epidemics.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/AIDS.nlogo
This model simulates the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), via sexual transmission, through a small isolated human population.  It therefore illustrates the effects of certain sexual practices across a population.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Altruism.nlogo
This model (and Cooperation and Divide the Cake) are part of the EACH unit ("Evolution of Altruistic and Cooperative Habits: Learning About Complexity in Evolution").  See http://ccl.northwestern.edu/cm/EACH/ for more information on the EACH unit.

models/Sample Models/Social Science/El Farol.nlogo
El Farol is a bar in Santa Fe, New Mexico.  The bar is popular --- especially on Thursday nights when they offer Irish music --- but sometimes becomes overcrowded and unpleasant. In fact, if the patrons of the bar think it will be overcrowded they stay home; otherwise they go enjoy themselves at El Farol.  This model explores what happens to the overall attendance at the bar on these popular Thursday evenings, as the patrons use different strategies for determining how crowded they think the bar will be.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Ethnocentrism.nlogo
This model, due to Robert Axelrod and Ross A. Hammond, suggests that "ethnocentric" behavior can evolve under a wide variety of conditions, even when there are no native "ethnocentrics" and no way to differentiate between agent types.  Agents compete for limited space via Prisoner Dilemma's type interactions. "Ethnocentric" agents treat agents within their group more beneficially than those outside their group.  The model includes a mechanism for inheritance (genetic or cultural) of strategies.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Language Change.nlogo
This model explores how the properties of language users and the structure of their social networks can affect the course of language change.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Party.nlogo
This is a model of a cocktail party.  The men and women at the party form groups.  A party-goer becomes uncomfortable and switches groups if their current group has too many members of the opposite sex.  What types of group result?
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Rebellion.nlogo
This project models the rebellion of a subjugated population against a central authority. It is is an adaptation of Joshua Epstein's model of civil violence (2002).
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Rumor Mill.nlogo
This program models the spread of a rumor.  The rumor spreads when a person who knows the rumor tells one of their neighbors.  In other words, spatial proximity is a determining factor as to how soon (and perhaps how often) a given individual will hear the rumor.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Scatter.nlogo
This model simulates students' ideas about scattering, which takes place just before exercising in gym. The students in a class start out all bunched up, and the teacher asks them to spread out or scatter.  This simulation shows the spread of the group when the individual students follow simple rules to decide whether to move and where.  The scatterers move according to rules that were gleaned from several interviews with sixth-grade students.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Segregation.nlogo
This project models the behavior of two types of turtles in a mythical pond. The red turtles and green turtles get along with one another. But each turtle wants to make sure that it lives near some of "its own." That is, each red turtle wants to live near at least some red turtles, and each green turtle wants to live near at least some green turtles. The simulation shows how these individual preferences ripple through the pond, leading to large-scale patterns.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Simple Birth Rates.nlogo
This is a simple model of population genetics.  There are two populations, the REDS and the BLUES. Each has settable birth rates.  The reds and blues move around and reproduce according to their birth rates.  When the carrying capacity of the terrain is exceeded, some agents die (each agent has the same chance of being selected for death) to maintain a relatively constant population.  The model allows you to explore how differential birth rates affect the ratio of reds to blues.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Sugarscape/Sugarscape 1 Immediate Growback.nlogo
This first model in the NetLogo Sugarscape suite implements Epstein & Axtell's Sugarscape Immediate Growback model, as described in chapter 2 of their book Growing Artificial Societies: Social Science from the Bottom Up. It simulates a population with limited, spatially-distributed resources available.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Sugarscape/Sugarscape 2 Constant Growback.nlogo
This second model in the NetLogo Sugarscape suite implements Epstein & Axtell's Sugarscape Constant Growback model, as described in chapter 2 of their book Growing Artificial Societies: Social Science from the Bottom Up. It simulates a population with limited, spatially-distributed resources available. It differs from Sugarscape 1 Immediate Growback in that the growback of sugar is gradual rather than instantaneous.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Sugarscape/Sugarscape 3 Wealth Distribution.nlogo
This third model in the NetLogo Sugarscape suite implements Epstein & Axtell's Sugarscape Wealth Distribution model, as described in chapter 2 of their book Growing Artificial Societies: Social Science from the Bottom Up. It provides a ground-up simulation of inequality in wealth. Only a minority of the population have above average wealth, while most agents have wealth near the same level as the initial endowment.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Team Assembly.nlogo
This model of collaboration networks illustrates how the behavior of individuals in assembling small teams for short-term projects can give rise to a variety of large-scale network structures over time.  It is an adaptation of the team assembly model presented by Guimera, Uzzi, Spiro & Amaral (2005).  The rules of the model draw upon observations of collaboration networks ranging from Broadway productions to scientific publications in psychology and astronomy.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Traffic Basic.nlogo
This model models the movement of cars on a highway. Each car follows a simple set of rules: it slows down (decelerates) if it sees a car close ahead, and speeds up (accelerates) if it doesn't see a car ahead.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Traffic Grid.nlogo
You control traffic lights and overall variables, such as the speed limit and the number of cars, in a real-time traffic simulation.  This allows you to explore traffic dynamics, which can lead into many areas of study, from calculus to social studies.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Unverified/Bank Reserves.nlogo
This program models the creation of money in an economy through a private banking system. As most of the money in the economy is kept in banks but only little of it needs to be used (i.e. in cash form) at any one time, the banks need only keep a small portion of their savings on-hand for those transactions. This portion of the total savings is known as the banks' reserves.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Unverified/Cash Flow.nlogo
This model is a simple extension of the model "Bank Reserves". The purpose of the model is to help the user examine whether there is a relationship between the reserve ratio that banks must keep and the degree of equality in the distribution of the money that exist in the system.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Unverified/Divide The Cake.nlogo
This model (and Cooperation and Altruism) are part of the EACH curriculum: "Evolution of Altruistic and Cooperative Habits: Learning About Complexity in Evolution".  See http://ccl.northwestern.edu/cm/EACH/ for more information.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Unverified/El Farol Network Congestion.nlogo
El Farol is a bar in Santa Fe.  The bar is popular, but becomes overcrowded when too many patrons attend.  Patrons are happy when less than a certain amount of patrons attend, say 60 for example, but they are unhappy when more than some other amount of patrons attend, say 70.  What will happen as time passes and people have pleasant or unpleasant experiences?
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Unverified/Hotelling's Law.nlogo
This model is a representation of Hotelling's law (1929), which examines the optimal placement of stores and pricing of their goods in order to maximize profit. In Hotelling's original paper, the stores were confined to a single dimension.  This model replicates and extends Hotelling's law, by allowing the stores to move freely on a plane.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Unverified/Minority Game.nlogo
This is a simplified model of an economic market.  In each time step, agents choose one of two sides, 0 or 1, and those on the minority side win a point.  This problem is inspired by the "El Farol" bar problem.  Each agent uses a finite set of strategies to make their decision based upon past record; however, the record consists only of which side, 0 or 1, was in the minority, not the actual population count of how many chose each side.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Unverified/Prisoner's Dilemma/PD Basic Evolutionary.nlogo
One of the most prominently studied phenomena in Game Theory is the "Prisoner's Dilemma."  The Prisoner's Dilemma, which was formulated by Melvin Drescher and Merrill Flood and named by Albert W. Tucker, is an example of a class of games called non-zero-sum games.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Unverified/Prisoner's Dilemma/PD Basic.nlogo
You and your partner have been arrested for robbing a bank and find yourselves in the classic prisoner's dilemma.  The police place each of you into separate rooms and come to you with the following proposal...
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Unverified/Prisoner's Dilemma/PD N-Person Iterated.nlogo
This model is a multiplayer version of the iterated prisoner's dilemma. It is intended to explore the strategic implications that emerge when the world consists entirely of prisoner's dilemma like interactions. If you are unfamiliar with the basic concepts of the prisoner's dilemma or the iterated prisoner's dilemma, please refer to the PD BASIC and PD TWO PERSON ITERATED models found in the PRISONER'S DILEMMA suite.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Unverified/Prisoner's Dilemma/PD Two Person Iterated.nlogo
This model is an iterated version of the prisoner's dilemma.  If you are unfamiliar with the basic concepts of the prisoner's dilemma, please refer to the PD Basic model found in the Prisoner's Dilemma suite.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Unverified/Traffic 2 Lanes.nlogo
This project is a more sophisticated two-lane version of the "Traffic Basic" model.  Much like the simpler model, this model demonstrates how traffic jams can form. In the two-lane version, drivers have a new option; they can react by changing lanes, although this often does little to solve their problem.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Unverified/Traffic Intersection.nlogo
In this model the turtles are cars traveling through an intersection.  The user has the ability to control the frequency of cars coming from each direction, the speed of the cars, and the timing of the light at the traffic intersection.  Once the frequency and speed of cars is selected, the user should run the simulation and adjust the timing of the traffic light so as to minimize the amount of waiting time of cars traveling through the intersection.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Voting.nlogo
This model is a simple cellular automaton that simulates voting distribution by having each patch take a "vote" of its eight surrounding neighbors, then perhaps change its own vote according to the outcome.
models/Sample Models/Social Science/Wealth Distribution.nlogo
This model simulates the distribution of wealth.  "The rich get richer and the poor get poorer" is a familiar saying that expresses inequity in the distribution of wealth.  In this simulation, we see Pareto's law, in which there are a large number of "poor" or red people, fewer "middle class" or green people, and many fewer "rich" or blue people.

This is a model of a logistic growth curve using the System Dynamics Modeler.
models/Sample Models/System Dynamics/Unverified/Tabonuco Yagrumo Hybrid.nlogo
This is a model of a simple ecosystem of two species of trees that compete for space in a forest canopy.  Tabonuco Yagrumo Hybrid is different from Tabonuco Yagrumo in that the competition for space is explicitly modeled using turtles and patches, as opposed to being modeled as a relationship between stocks in the System Dynamics Modeler.  It is intended to be a simple example of how the two approaches can be combined into a hybrid model, and its behavior is similar to the non-hybrid version.
models/Sample Models/System Dynamics/Unverified/Tabonuco Yagrumo.nlogo
This is a system dynamics model of a simple ecosystem.  Two species of trees -- tabonuco and yagrumo -- compete for space in a forest canopy.  This model illustrates the role of hurricane destruction in this ecosystem, as well as the resultant nitrogen and carbon produced by the ecosystem.
models/Sample Models/System Dynamics/Wolf Sheep Predation (docked).nlogo
This model explores the relationship between two different models of predator-prey ecosystems: an agent-based model and a aggregate model.  Each of the models can be run separately, or docked side-by-side for comparison.
models/Sample Models/System Dynamics/Wolf Sheep Predation (System Dynamics).nlogo
This is a model of a simple predator-prey ecosystem. It uses the System Dynamics Modeler to implement the Lotka-Volterra equations.
