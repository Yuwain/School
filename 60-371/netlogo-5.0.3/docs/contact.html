      Reporting bugs
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our public bug tracker is on GitHub at <a href=
      "https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/issues">https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/issues</a>.
      You can look here to report a new bug, check if a bug has already
      been reported, and so on.
    <p>
      When submitting a bug report, please try to include as much of the
      following information as possible:
    <ul>
      <li>A complete description of the problem and how it occurred.
      <li>The NetLogo model or code you are having trouble with. If
      possible, attach a complete model. (It's best if you can reduce
      the amount of code in the model to the minimum necessary to
      demonstrate the bug.)
      <li>Your system information: NetLogo version, OS version, Java
      version, and so on. This information is available from NetLogo's
      &quot;About NetLogo&quot; menu item, then clicking the System tab. In
      applets, the same information is available by right-clicking the
      white background of the applet.
      <li>Any error messages that were displayed. Please copy and paste the
      entire error message into your email, or make a screen capture if you
      are unable to copy and paste.
