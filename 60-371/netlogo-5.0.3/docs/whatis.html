      <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>What is NetLogo?
    </h1>
    <p>
      <b>NetLogo</b> is a programmable modeling environment for simulating
      natural and social phenomena. It was authored by Uri Wilensky in 1999
      and has been in continuous development ever since at the Center for
      Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling.
    <p>
      <b>NetLogo</b> is particularly well suited for modeling complex
      systems developing over time. Modelers can give instructions to
      hundreds or thousands of &quot;agents&quot; all operating
      independently. This makes it possible to explore the connection
      between the micro-level behavior of individuals and the macro-level
      patterns that emerge from their interaction.
    <p>
      <b>NetLogo</b> lets students open simulations and &quot;play&quot;
      with them, exploring their behavior under various conditions. It is
      also an authoring environment which enables students, teachers and
      curriculum developers to create their own models. NetLogo is simple
      enough for students and teachers, yet advanced enough to serve as a
      powerful tool for researchers in many fields.
    <p>
      <b>NetLogo</b> has extensive documentation and tutorials. It also
      comes with the Models Library, a large collection of pre-written
      simulations that can be used and modified. These simulations address
      content areas in the natural and social sciences including biology
      and medicine, physics and chemistry, mathematics and computer
      science, and economics and social psychology. Several model-based
      inquiry curricula using NetLogo are available and more are under
      development.
    <p>
      <b>NetLogo</b> can also power a classroom participatory-simulation
      tool called HubNet. Through the use of networked computers or
      handheld devices such as Texas Instruments graphing calculators, each
      student can control an agent in a simulation. Follow <a href=
      "hubnet.html">this link</a> for more information.
    <p>
      <b>NetLogo</b> is the next generation of the series of multi-agent
      modeling languages including StarLogo and StarLogoT. NetLogo runs on
      the Java virtual machine, so it works on all major platforms (Mac,
      Windows, Linux, et al). It is run as a standalone application. Models
      and HubNet activities can be run as Java applets in a web browser.
      Command line operation is also supported.
