      Profiler Extension
    </h1>
    <p>
      If you'd like your model to run faster, the profiler extension
      may be useful to you. It includes primitives that measure how many
      times the procedures in your model are called during a run and how
      long each call takes. You can use this information to where to focus
      your speedup efforts.
    <h2>
      Caution
    </h2>
    <p>
      The profiler extension is experimental. It is not yet well tested or
      user friendly. Nonetheless, we think some users will find it useful.
    <h2>
      Usage
    </h2>
    <p>
      The profiler extension comes preinstalled. To use the extension in
      your model, add a line to the top of your Code tab:
    <pre>
extensions [profiler]
</pre>
    <p>
      If your model already uses other extensions, then it already has an
      <a href="dictionary.html#extensions"><tt>extensions</tt></a> line in
      it, so just add <tt>profiler</tt> to the list.
    <p>
      For more information on using NetLogo extensions, see the <a href=
      "extensions.html">Extensions Guide</a>.
    <h3>
      Example
    </h3>
    <pre>
setup                  ;; set up the model
profiler:start         ;; start profiling
repeat 20 [ go ]       ;; run something you want to measure
profiler:stop          ;; stop profiling
print profiler:report  ;; view the results
profiler:reset         ;; clear the data
</pre>

      Reports the exclusive time, in milliseconds, that

      from when the procedure was entered, until it finishes, but does not
      include any time spent in other user-defined procedures which it

      Reports the inclusive time, in milliseconds, that

      from when the procedure was entered, until it finishes.
    <p>

      Reports a string containing a breakdown of all user-defined procedure
      calls. The <code>Calls</code> column contains the number of times a
      user-defined procedure was called. The <code>Incl T(ms)</code> column
      is the total time, in milliseconds, it took for the call to complete,
      including the time spent in other user-defined procedures. The
      <code>Excl T(ms)</code> column is the total time, in milliseconds,
      spent within that user-defined procedure, not counting other
      user-define procedures it called. The <code>Excl/calls</code> column
      is an estimate of the time, in milliseconds, spent in that
      user-defined procedure for each call.
