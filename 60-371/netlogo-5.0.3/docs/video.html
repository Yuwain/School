    <h2>
      What does the QuickTime Extension do?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The QuickTime Extension allows you to interact with and create images
      for importing from webcams and movie files.
    <h2>
      Installing the QuickTime Extension
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Windows
    </h3>
    <p>
      First, make sure you have QuickTime installed if you don't you
      can download it here:
    <p>
      <a href=
      "http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/</a>
    <p>
      A few files from your QuickTime installation need to be moved into
      the extension directory in order for the video extension to work.
    <ul>
      <li>Copy <tt>C:\Program Files\QuickTime\QTSystem\QTJava.zip</tt> into
      the extension directory and rename it <tt>QTJava.jar</tt>.
      <li>Make a directory called <tt>lib</tt> in the QTJ extension
      directory, then create a directory called <tt>Windows</tt> inside
      <tt>lib</tt>.
      <li>Copy <tt>C:\Program
      Files\QuickTime\QTSystem\QTJavaNative.dll</tt> and <tt>C:\Program
      Files\QuickTime\QTSystem\QTJNative.dll</tt> into the <tt>Windows</tt>
      directory.
      </ul>
    <p>
      You will also need to install a digitizer, we recommend WinVDIG which
      can be downloaded here:
    <p>
      <a href=
      "http://www.eden.net.nz/7/20071008/">http://www.eden.net.nz/7/20071008/</a>
    <p>
      You must install version 1.0.1 not a newer version.
    <p>
      You can then test that QTJ and the digitizer are installed correctly
      through their test application QTCap. (If you have trouble, see
      <a href="contact.html">Contacting Us</a>.)
    <p>
      On Windows Vista you will need to start NetLogo as administrator in
      order to use the video extension. You can do so by right clicking on
      the executable and selecting &quot;Run As Administrator&quot;. You
      can also permanently change this setting: open the properties dialog,
      select the Compatibility tab and select &quot;Run As
      Administrator&quot; checkbox.
    <h3>
      Mac OS X
    </h3>
    <p>
      A few files from your QuickTime installation need to be moved into
      the extension directory in order for the video extension to work.
    <ul>
      <li>Copy <tt>/System/Library/Java/Extensions/QTJava.zip</tt> into the
      extension directory and rename it <tt>QTJava.jar</tt>.
      <li>Make a directory called <tt>lib</tt> in the QTJ extension
      directory, then create a directory called <tt>Mac OS X</tt> inside
      <tt>lib</tt>.
      <li>Copy <tt>/System/Library/Java/Extensions/libQTJNative.jnilib</tt>
      into the <tt>Mac OS X</tt> directory.
      </ul>
    <p>
      Also, on 64-bit Macs (which includes all currently sold models), you
      will need to change NetLogo to run in 32-bit mode in order to use the
      extension. If you don't, the usual result is a
      java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError dialog. Here are the steps to follow:
    <ul>
      <li>Select the NetLogo application icon in the Finder.
      <li>On the File menu, choose Get Info.
      <li>Check this checkbox: &quot;Open in 32-bit mode&quot;
      <li>Open the application.
      </ul>
    <p>
      If you want, you can make a copy of the application first and
      performs these steps on the copy, so the original still opens in
      64-bit mode. (64-bit mode is the recommended default unless you are
      using this extension.)
    <h3>
      Linux
    </h3>
    <p>
      The QuickTime Extension is not compatible with Linux, because Apple
      does not have a Linux version of QuickTime.
    <h2>
      Getting started
    </h2>
    <p>
      To import images from webcams and movies into NetLogo you will need
      to include both the QTJ and the Bitmap Extensions.

    <p>
      There are two code examples that present the basic functions of these
      extensions.

      select one a connection is opened with the selected camera at the
      given resolution. If you use <tt>camera-select</tt> you do not need
      to call <tt>camera-start</tt>. You must call either select or start
