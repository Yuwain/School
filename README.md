Computer science assignments written by Jeremy High

Several assignments for certain classes (212, 254, 322) have been lost due to a tragic incident in which my laptop temporarily became a paperweight 

A good fraction of assignments are documented. If there is no documentation for a file, it is either because I figured (incorrectly) that it was not necessary, the assignment has bonus marks for length and comments added to such (60-214), or that it completely slipped my mind at the time.
